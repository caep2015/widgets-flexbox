The Iron Yard Week 1, Day 4: In class activity

## Activity: Widgets - Practice with Flexbox 

## The biggest task is to layout all the page elements using flexbox.

The goal of this activity is twofold: First it gives you some experience implementing a layout with flexbox. Second, it gives you some experience seeing a slightly more complex webpage. Read through all of the HTML and CSS to understand how the site is put together and then step through the TODOs to complete the layout.

## This site also has two pages:
• index.html - The homepage for our widgets site
• products.html - The products list page for our widget site.

## Instructions   
•Download the source files and unpack them
•Review the mockups, the HTML, and CSS
•Complete all of the TODOs found in the style.css file
•Without modifying the given HTML document, style it to match the 'Widgets' mockup
